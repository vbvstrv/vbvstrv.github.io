	In Fall 2023, I will be starting as a PhD student at University of Western Ontario, in London, Ontario, Canada. I'll be working under <a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/index.html">Chris Kapulkin</a>.
	
		Some day I will write a pithy description of my actual research (maybe once it actually gets more under way!). For now, the TLDR version is: I'm interested in homotopy theory, (higher) category theory, ∞-categories, stable homotopy theory, and higher algebra.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A list of things I am trying to learn right now (let me know if you are interested in learning about any of these with me!):
	<ul>
		<li>(Higher) Operads</li>
		<li>Graph Theory (specifically with an eye towards homotopy theory, sometimes called A1-homotopy theory)</li>
		<li>K-Theory</li>
		<li>Higher Algebra</li>
	</ul>
	
		Stuff that I want to learn eventually but don't have time or energy:
	<ul>
		<li>Chromatic Homotopy Theory</li>
		<li>Rational Homotopy Theory</li>
		<li>Motivic Homotopy Theory</li>
		<li>Homotopy Type Theory, proof assistants (LEAN, etc.), formalization</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	I graduated in summer 2022 with a master's degree in Mathematics from UC Santa Cruz. My master's thesis was called <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8bh298gg">Stable ∞-Categories and Their Homotopy Categories</a>; my advisor was <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~beren/">Beren Sanders</a>.
