	<p>I typically hang out with non-math people more than math people. Mostly they are (affectionately) "freaks" : film people, musicians, punks, poets, ... I'm often in a situation in which I'm talking to non-math friends and have to describe what "topology" (broadly speaking, the subfield which I'm interested in) is. I find that people are usually really excited by it, but because the prerequisites for math are so numerous, inaccessible, and time-consuming, they don't know how to start. I wanted to create a class for my friends, but also for anybody who is not a "math-person" and may not be interested in researching, but simply in the beauty (which abounds), or even interested in the tools of topology, which are slowly being adopted into other fields (eg. the role of continuity and topological thinking in microtonal music, or category theory in the humanities).</p>
	
	<p>Out of this need was born this idea for a class called "Topology for Freaks": a (hopefully) accessible introduction to topology for non-math majors.</p>
	
	<p>THE STRUCTURE: We will be using the book <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~hrm/palestine/armstrong-basic-topology.pdf">"Basic Topology"</a> by Armstrong (see RESOURCES below). I plan on posting lecture videos irregularly on youtube (videos and notes will be posted on this page), which people can watch in their own time. There is also a <a href="https://discord.gg/2TyYpTKv9B">Discord server</a>, in which I hope anybody interested will talk to each other, ask questions, think about problems or applications of the machinery we will be discussing. Or just to share beautiful math things or memes :).</p>
