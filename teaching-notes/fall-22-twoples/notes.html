		QUESTIONS:
		<ul>
			<li>What does it mean to say that homotopical algebra is a "non-abelian/non-linear" generalization of homological algebra -- how can we recognize classical homological algebra as a special type of homotopical algebra?</li>
			<li>What is the role of derived functors in the above, and how do Ext and Tor functors "measure non-abelianness/non-exactness" of a category?</li>
			<li>Model categories and infinity-categories are two ways of describing homotopy theories; what is the relationship between the two? How much can one transfer from one to the other? What are pros/cons to either?</li>
			<li>What is a homotopy limit/colimit? How do we describe them via model categories? Via ∞-categories? Can we relate them? How do they look specifically in the case of a (model or ∞-) category of spaces?</li>
			<li>What are Kan extensions, and how and why do they show up seemingly everywhere? (In particular, we can describe ordinary limits/colimits and homotopy limits/colimits as Kan extensions.) The ∞-version of Kan extensions are called (at least on n-lab) "homotopy Kan extensions" -- how do these work and relate to ordinary Kan extensions?</li>
			<li>The right notion of an equivalence of homotopy theories (described as model categories) is a "Quillen equivalence". What is the analogue in ∞-land, and how do they relate? (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03146">this paper</a>)</li>
			<li>Given a (strict? weak?) 2-category C, can we describe a "2-nerve" -- ie. a quasi-category NC whose objects, 1-morphisms, and 2-morphisms are those of C, with higher simplices witnessing compositions of 1-morphisms in a suitable way. (The homotopy 2-category of this guy as in [Riehl-Verity] should recover the 2-category C.) There are two ways to compose 2-morphisms in a 2-category: "horizontally" and "vertically" (see Cats in Context -- Riehl). Can we describe either or both of these in terms of horn filling in the "2-nerve"?</li>
			<li>There is something called a dg-category : a category that has hom-differential graded <b>Z</b>-modules. I think one can take these as a model for higher categories or ∞-categories? Or one can try... I think they're also related to A_{infinity} categories, but idk what that is.</li>
			<li>Read <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0007070">this paper</a> about "universal homotopy theories" -- starting from a (small) category, one can form a model category by formally sticking in homotopy colimits.</li>
			<li>Learn something about 2-categories (I think there are some intro papers by Benabou, but there may be more modern sources). In particular, it seems that we can describe the ∞-versions of many categorical concepts (adjunctions, limits, ...) only up to the 2-level. How far does this go? I don't think all of ordinary category theory is 2-categorical, but it seems that a large part is (a hint of this is the Riehl-Verity stuff about the homotopy 2-category). Are there certain things that definitely cannot be described 2-categorically? See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLkRhKaw5DA">this talk</a> (this is a great talk for just ∞-stuff in general, but I think he also mentions at some point the 2-categorical nature of some of the stuff).</li>
			<li>There are other models of homotopy theories besides ∞-categories and model categories. For example, "relative categories", which are like pared down model categories that have just the weak equivalences identified (there's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.1691">this paper</a>). There are also simplicial categories (which form a model of ∞-categories). Are some of these suited for certain things, or not suited for certain things?</li>
			<li>There is something called the Reedy model structure, which is a way of describing a model structure on a category of functors (ie. a category of the form Fun(C,D)). These show up for example when describing limits/colimits as adjoints (the functor categories in question look like Fun(I,C), ie. I-shaped diagrams in a category C). See <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Reedy+model+structure">here</a>, but I'm sure there are better sources.</li>
